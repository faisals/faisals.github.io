### Enhanced Career Timeline Implementation
- Created new `timeline` branch for development
- Implemented sophisticated career progression visualization with three viewing modes:
  - Interactive timeline view with SVG-based visual indicators
  - Sparkline chart showing career trajectory over time  
  - Table view with sortable metrics and role details
- Enhanced timeline dynamically generates from `resume.json` data structure
- Added Tufte-style design principles with site's color scheme integration
- Positioned timeline above "About" section with proper figcaption
- Fixed layout issues preventing table view overlap with other sections
- Integrated site's accent colors (#b20808 red, #111 text, #666 secondary)
- Successfully merged timeline branch back to master
- Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub repository

### Technical Details
- Added 483-line `EnhancedTimeline` class to `advanced-animations.js`
- Added 230 lines of timeline-specific CSS to `animations.css` 
- Modified `site-generator.js` to initialize timeline from resume data
- Timeline reads from `meta.careerTimeline` array in `resume.json`

- Uses ResizeObserver for responsive design
- All data remains fully driven by JSON configuration
